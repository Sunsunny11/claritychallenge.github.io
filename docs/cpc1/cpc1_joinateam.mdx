## Find a collaborator

If you'd like to Team up with someone else to compete in the challenges, we can help. Please complete [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexEv2FU34VMM9bR5w7dUnfqUw5aWX8aWHizVSBrFv1-B3PoQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to let us know your own expertise, and what you're looking for in a collaborator. We'll then put people in contact with possible collaborators.



We encourage everyone to join the [Clarity Challengeâ€™s Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clarity-challenge) to stay updated with project news and announcements. We post in there when we have new people seeking team members (we don't share any personally-identifying details to the group). 

You are welcome to contact us if you have any questions about forming a team or participating in the challenge:
