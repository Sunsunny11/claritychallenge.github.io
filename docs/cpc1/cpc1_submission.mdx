## Registration

Teams are required to [register](./cpc1_registration) to help us organise the challenge.

## What evaluation data is provided?

The evaluation data consists of audio signals processed by hearing aid systems, clean reference signals, listener metadata, and a mapping of which listeners listened to which scenes/hearing aid systems. 
 
## What do I need to submit?

You must submit your predicted intelligibility scores for the signals provided.

We also encourage you to submit your prediction model(s) code.

## Naming and packaging data

Your data should be named according to your entry number, which will take the format CPC1_EXXX. These should be placed in a directory whose name is the unique team ID that you will be sent, e.g., `E001` and  then packaged using `zip` or `tar` or any standard packaging tool.


## Technical report

**The two page technical report must be submitted as a paper to the Clarity-CPC1-2022 Workshop. Deadline 25th April 2022**. An author kit and submission instructions will be made available.

**A draft of the report needs to be uploaded to the Google Drive along  with your prediction model outputs for the evaluation dataset by 21st March**. The draft needs to be sufficiently complete for us to judge whether your system(s)/model(s) is compliant with the challenge rules. You can find a list of key challenge dates [here.](./cpc1_dates)

Your report should include an abstract and introduction and sections on experimental setup/methodology including system/model information and model/network architecture, evaluation/results, discussion, conclusion and references. Please provide an estimation of the computational resources needed. You must describe any external data and pre-existing tools, software and models used. Please make it clear how your system(s)/model(s) meet the challenge rules.

Your report should cite the following document, which provides an overview of the challenge and the baseline system:

_S. Graetzer, J. Barker, T. J. Cox, M. Akeroyd, J. F. Culling, G. Naylor, E. Porter, and R. Viveros Muñoz, “Clarity-2021 challenges: Machine learning challenges for advancing hearing aid processing,” in Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH 2021, Brno, Czech Republic, 2021._

## How will intellectual property be handled?

See [here](./cpc1_rules#intellectual-property) under Intellectual Property.

## Where do I submit the data and code?

When you have registered you will receive a link to a Google Drive to which you will be able to securely upload your data. We also encourage you to submit your prediction model(s) code via this link.

Materials uploaded will be visible to the Clarity Team but not to other entrants.

:::warning

Note, in order to use the Google Drive you will need to have a Google account. If you anticipate problems using Google then please make arrangements to send us the materials by other means, e.g., via a service such as WeTransfer or similar.
