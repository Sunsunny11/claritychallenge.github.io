:::caution
TODO: `intelligibility scores` section needs updating/reviewing after task description is finalised
:::

## Registration

Teams are required to [register](./cpc2_registration) to help us organise the challenge. Registered teams will be assigned a unique team ID.

## What evaluation data is provided?

The evaluation data consists of audio signals processed by hearing aid systems, clean reference signals, listener metadata, and a mapping of which listeners listened to which scenes/hearing aid systems.

The evaluation data is will be made available when the submission period opens. See the [download](./cpc2_download) page for more details.

Note, the evaluation data does not contain the listener responses. We will score your submission for you and return your score (we aim to do this within 24 hours for of submission). We will then release the true listener responses the day after the submission deadline to allow teams to perform analysis of their results.

## What do I need to submit?

All teams must submit

- Their predicted intelligibility scores
- A two page technical report

### The predicted intelligibility scores

You must submit your predicted intelligibility scores for the signals provided.

The predictions should be sent in CSV format files with two columns:

```csv
signal_ID, intelligibility_score
```

Where the `signal_ID` is the unique signal identifier used for the wav file name (e.g., `S08510_L0239_E001`) and `intelligibility_score` is the predicted intelligibilty given in terms of the percentage words recognised correctly for the signal (i.e., for 0 to 100).

Your CSV files should be named as follows  `CPC2_<TEAM_ID>.csv`, where `<TEAM_ID>` is your individual team ID, e.g. 'E001'.

The files should be sent as email attachments to the email address: [claritychallengecontact@gmail.com](mailto:claritychallengecontact@gmail.com)

Please use "CPC2 Submission <TEAM_ID>" as the subject line.

We also encourage you to make your prediction model code available via an open-source license, but this is not a pre-requisite for entry (see [challenge rules](../cpc2_rules#)).

:::info
All registered teams will be emailed with a reminder of their unique team ID shortly before the submission deadline. If you plan to submit please register before the submission deadline.

### The technical report

**The two page technical report must be submitted in the format required for the Clarity-2023 Workshop. An author kit and submission instructions will be made available.

**A draft of the report needs to be submitted along with your predictions**. The draft needs to be sufficiently complete for us to judge whether your system(s)/model(s) is compliant with the challenge rules. You can find a list of key challenge dates [here.](../cpc2_dates)

Your report should include an abstract and introduction and sections on experimental setup/methodology including system/model information and model/network architecture, evaluation/results, discussion, conclusion and references. Please provide an estimation of the computational resources needed. You must describe any external data and pre-existing tools, software and models used. Please make it clear how your system(s)/model(s) meet the challenge rules.

## How will intellectual property be handled?
