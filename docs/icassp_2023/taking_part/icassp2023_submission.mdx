:::info
All teams are [required to register](./icassp2023_registration) prior to submission and before the registration deadline August 28th.
:::

Submissions will be evaluated using a combination of HASPI and HASPI to give a combined speech intelligibility and speech quality metric.

Key dates.

- **1st Feb 2023**: Release of test and eval, plus core software.
- **8th Feb 2023**: Submission by teams.
- **13th Feb 2023**: Results released.Top 5 ranked teams invited to submit papers to ICASSP-2023
- **20th Feb 2023**: Invited papers submitted to ICASSP-2023
- **4-9th June 2023**: Overview paper and invited papers presented at dedicated ICASSP session

## What evaluation data is provided?

The evaluation data consists of 1500 scenes. For each scene, you are provided with the signals received at each of the three microphones on the left and right hearing aid device. You will also be provided with JSON or csv formatted metadata consisting of

  1. the audiograms and DTT results for a set of listeners and
  2. a mapping of which listeners will listen to which scenes.

There will also be some clean audio examples for the target talker, that are not the same as the target utterance.

For HASPI/HASQI evaluation, there will be one listener per scene and the scene-listener mapping will be the same for all teams.

## What audio do I need to submit?

You must submit the audio signals produced at the output of your simulated hearing aid for the evaluation datasets. You will be asked to provide signalsfor HASPI/HASQI evaluation (see submission dates above).

Signals should be submitted as 16-bit WAV files with a 32 kHz sampling rate.

## Naming and packaging signals

Your processed signals should be named using the conventions used by the baseline system, i.e., `<Scene ID>_<Listener ID>_HA-output.wav` and explained on the [CEC2 data page](../data/cec2_data#d6-enhanced-sinals).
These should be placed in a directory whose name is the unique team ID that you will be sent, e.g., `E001` and  then packaged using `zip` or `tar` or any standard packaging tool.
The resulting file should be about 2 GB.

## Technical report

- The technical report must be submitted as a paper to the ICASSP 2023 special session. Deadline - see date above. An author kit and submission instructions will be made available.
- A draft of the report needs to be uploaded to the Google Drive along with your signals for evaluation - see above for deadline. The draft needs to be sufficiently complete for us to judge whether your system is compliant with the challenge rules.
- Your report should include an abstract and introduction and sections on experimental setup/methodology including system information and model/network architecture, evaluation/results, discussion, conclusion and references. Please provide an estimation of the computational resources needed. You must describe any external data and pre-existing tools, software and models used.

## How will intellectual property be handled?

See [here](./icassp2023_rules#intellectual-property) under Intellectual Property.

## Where do I submit the signals?

When you have registered you will receive a link to a Google Drive to which you will be able to securely upload your signals. You will be able to use the same link to upload materials for both the 1st submission and the 2nd submission if you are selected for the 2nd round. We also encourage you to submit your simulated hearing aid code via this link.

Materials uploaded will be visible to the Clarity Team but not to other entrants.

:::warning
Note, in order to use the Google Drive you will need to have a Google account. If you anticipate problems using Google then please make arrangements to send us the materials by other means, e.g., via a service such as WeTransfer or similar.
