### Software

All the necessary software tools are available as a single [GitHub repository](https://github.com/claritychallenge/clarity).

A new version of the repository code will shortly be released  (v0.2.0, expected Tues 29th Nov)this will contain a `recipe` for running the baseline and standard evaluation  (`recipes/icassp2023`). 

### Data

The data is available for [download here](https://mab.to/KjXsa3EskhQuU).

On the download site you will see three data packages are available,

- `clarity_CEC2_core.v1_1.tgz`  [**28 GB**] - metadata and dev set
- `clarity_CEC2_train.v1_1.tgz` [**69 GB**] - scenes for training systems
- `clarity_CEC2_hoairs.v1_0.tgz` [**144 GB**] - impulse responses for generating extended training data

All participants will require the **core** data package. Participants using machine learning approaches will additionally require the **train** data package. Participants wishing to extend the training set by using our provided scene rendering tools will also require the high order ambisonic impulse responses (i.e., the **hoairs** package).

To unpack the data we recommend you follow the instructions in the [Clarity Challenge GitHub repository](https://github.com/claritychallenge/clarity).
